# Design Patterns Across Languages

Hey coders! ðŸ‘‹,

I'm exploring design patterns in various languagesâ€”Go, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, C#, Python, Lua, Rust, Scala. The focus? It's all about ideas, not the language specifics.

## Why Design Patterns Matter
Think of design patterns as universal problem-solving recipes. They work anywhere, like dance steps that fit every tune.

## The Lineup
- **Go (Golang):** Concurrency wizard with goroutines.
- **C:** The rockstar crafting the essentials.
- **C++:** Versatile, with object-oriented powers.
- **Java:** Reliable, embracing "write once, run anywhere."
- **JavaScript:** Wild dancer, from browser to server.
- **C#:** Suave talker, adding elegance to Windows apps.
- **Python:** Laid-back conversationalist making code feel like a chat.
- **Lua:** Stealthy ninja scripting language.
- **Rust:** Handyman ensuring performance with safety.
- **Scala:** Cosmic voyager, blending object-oriented and functional vibes.

## It's About Ideas
This repo emphasizes that design patterns transcend languages. They're adaptable, applicable anywhere. Whether it's Golang or Python, the goal is to showcase universal patterns.
